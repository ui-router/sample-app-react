The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.\n * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.\n * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.\n * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id\n *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.\n * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the\n *   path into the parameter 'path'.\n * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.\n * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches \"/calendar/2014-11-12\" (because the pattern defined\n *   in the built-in  `date` ParamType matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start\n *\n */\nvar UrlMatcher = /** @class */ (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param pattern The pattern to compile into a matcher.\n     * @param paramTypes The [[ParamTypes]] registry\n     * @param config  A configuration object\n     * - `caseInsensitive` - `true` if URL matching should be case insensitive, otherwise `false`, the default value (for backward compatibility) is `false`.\n     * - `strict` - `false` if matching against a URL with a trailing slash should be treated as equivalent to a URL without a trailing slash, the default value is `true`.\n     */\n    function UrlMatcher(pattern, paramTypes, paramFactory, config) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.config = config;\n        /** @hidden */\n        this._cache = { path: [this] };\n        /** @hidden */\n        this._children = [];\n        /** @hidden */\n        this._params = [];\n        /** @hidden */\n        this._segments = [];\n        /** @hidden */\n        this._compiled = [];\n        this.pattern = pattern;\n        this.config = common_1.defaults(this.config, {\n            params: {},\n            strict: true,\n            caseInsensitive: false,\n            paramMap: common_1.identity,\n        });\n        // Find all placeholders and create a compiled pattern, using either classic or curly syntax:\n        //   '*' name\n        //   ':' name\n        //   '{' name '}'\n        //   '{' name ':' regexp '}'\n        // The regular expression is somewhat complicated due to the need to allow curly braces\n        // inside the regular expression.
